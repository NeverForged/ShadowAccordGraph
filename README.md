# Shadow Accord Social Graph
A small project initiated to see what would happen if I made a social graph of a LARP community, in this case [Shadow Accord](http://nwlarpers.org/).

**Data Gathering**
The data for this was self-reported from the players, at first through a *facebook* post from the player base.  This of course proved to be a huge hassle for me, since I was pulling the data one *edge* at a time.  Since then, I have placed the csv file in a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/129G63ksV6ZNEokMIliqbod6Do_dyP8dn4Av8aCZ7hbI/edit?usp=sharing) to allow players to edit their own edges, as well as character names.  

**Results**
Will be posted later, once the data is more useable.

**Future Direction(s)**
One possible use for this would be to help staff determine what sub-factions exist among the player base.  If this were to be done, I would suggest that player edges be limited to some reasonable number, and updated every event, based on a combination of a *character database* and some sort of response, like a *post event letter* where players give feedback.  A filtered drop-down where the players can list the characters they have relationships with (limited however staff finds most useful) would be best.
